Project uStudy for uOttahack 6
Team Omar Ouadouha and Hamza Bouzoubaa

# uStudy

## Inspiration
Our journey began with a clear vision: to transform the landscape of collaborative learning. Recognizing the limitations of existing educational platforms, we were inspired to create uStudy—a space where technology meets education to provide personalized support through AI and foster a community of learners. The drive came from witnessing students' struggles to find effective study groups and resources tailored to their specific courses, sparking the idea to integrate specialized chatbots and discussion rooms into one seamless platform. The speech that the presenter made about wanting to revolutionize education at uOttawa and make a vision for 2030 was also a big inspiration as we would like to give back to our university and make sure that future students have better education.

## What it does
uStudy revolutionizes the way students collaborate and learn. At its core, the platform features:

- **Specialized Chatbots:** AI-powered, course-specific chatbots provide instant assistance, answering queries and aiding study sessions.
- **Discussion Rooms:** Dynamic spaces that professors can customize for each course, enhancing targeted learning and peer interaction.
- **Course Dashboard:** A centralized hub displaying recent grades and upcoming assignments with looming deadlines, designed to keep students on track with their academic responsibilities.

## How we built it
uStudy was brought to life through a combination of modern web technologies and AI. We leveraged Bootstrap for a responsive and intuitive frontend, ensuring accessibility across devices. The backend, powered by Flask with Python, handles real-time data processing and integrates our AI chatbots, trained on course-specific material using RAG technology. The synergy of these technologies provided the foundation for a platform that is both powerful and user-friendly.

## Challenges we ran into
The development of uStudy was not without its hurdles. Training AI chatbots to accurately understand and respond to a wide array of academic topics required extensive data curation. Implementing a scalable system for the dynamic creation and management of discussion rooms tested our engineering mettle. Additionally, developing a user-friendly dashboard that accurately represents complex academic data in real-time presented a significant design challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take pride in several key accomplishments:

- **Creating a Unified Learning Environment:** Successfully integrating chatbots, discussion rooms, and a dashboard into a cohesive platform.
- **AI Implementation:** Developing sophisticated AI chatbots that can accurately assist with course-specific inquiries.
- **User Engagement:** Building a platform that not only meets the technical specifications but is also engaging and easy to use for students.

## What we learned
This project was a profound learning experience. We gained deeper insights into web development, AI, and the intricacies of creating a platform that serves diverse educational needs. The importance of user feedback in shaping a user-centric design and the challenges of AI in educational contexts were key lessons that will guide our future endeavors.

## What's next for uStudy
The future of uStudy is bright and full of potential. We plan to:

- **Professor Participation:** Create a professor portal where they can modify the content of their courses and train the AI models with more content.
- **Expand Course Content:** Enrich our database to cover more disciplines and courses.
- **Enhance AI Capabilities:** Improve the accuracy and responsiveness of our chatbots.
- **Grow the Community:** Foster a larger, more active user base to enhance collaborative learning.
- **Incorporate Feedback:** Continuously refine the platform based on user input, ensuring uStudy remains at the forefront of educational innovation.
